\section{Results}
\paragraph{Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]
	\item Develop a Relational Database Schema for your dataset. What logical integrity constraints (ICs) can you identify? Load the data into a SQLite database with your target schema. Use SQL queries to profile the dataset and to check the ICs that you have identified! Think of the queries as denials that retrieve those rows that can be used as ``witnesses'' of the IC violations.
	\item Create a Workflow Model of your data cleaning workflow: What are the key inputs and outputs of your overall workflow? What are the dependencies? Create a visual version of your overall workflow using the yw tool. If you've used OpenRefine, also use the or2yw tool to create a YW model from your OpenRefine recipe.
	\item Provide a clear way to showcase the overall changes you've done with the dataset. This can be tables that documents how many cells you changed in what steps of the cleaning process. Or this can be a way to show the dataset before and after cleaning (something similar to the `diff' codes you've seen in our OpenRefine assignment).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
	\item further discuss our sql schema (e.g. integrity constraints)
	\item denial queries?
	\item workflow model
	\item how many did we ``clean''? (5,239,239 hex strings in 287,987 function calls)
	\item show an example of a cleaned function \texttt{args} and \texttt{ret\_val}
\end{itemize}
