\subsection{K-Nearest Neighbors}

The first of our 3 methods performed quite poorly. Table \ref{fig:knn} shows the test accuracy for our keypoint extracted nearest neighbor classifiers. We tried K values ranging from 1 to 100 but found as expected that the elbow point for this dataset was quite low. We concluded that the best value was actually 1 neighbor.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline
	\textbf{K value} & \textbf{Test Accuracy}\\ \hline
	 1 & 0.0965\\ \hline

	5  & 0.0733\\ \hline
	10  & 0.04\\ \hline
