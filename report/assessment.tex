\section{Initial Assessment}
\paragraph{Requirements}
Here you should describe the structure (i.e., schema) and content of the dataset and quality issues that are apparent from an initial inspection. You should also describe a (hypothetical or real) use case of the dataset and derive from it some data cleaning goals that can achieve the desired fitness for use of this dataset. Also answer these questions: Are there use cases for which the dataset is already ``clean enough''? Are there related use cases for which the dataset will never be good enough? You can speculate a bit here - but the rest of the project should focus on a ``middle of the road'' use case that requires a practically feasible amount of data cleaning. All of these points and answers should be written up in narrative form.

\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
	\item too much data. we looked at traces from 3k websites that were crawled, from rank 1 to 3150 (150 of them weren't crawled).
	\item put trace json structure and discuss here.
\end{itemize}
