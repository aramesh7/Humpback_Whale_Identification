\section{Member Roles}
We ended up pair programming most of the setting up the dev environment and collecting the dataset, etc. We initially tried using a VM, but then we settled on using Google Colab for the free GPU access it provides. We are used a shared Jupyter notebook on Google Colab. Broadly speaking, the work was split up in the following way: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ashwin Ramesh : Explore methods and parameter optimizations. 
    \item Ram Gupta : Explore data transformations and structural optimizations
    \item Suyup Kim : Explore training/testing regimes and model selection. 
\end{itemize}
