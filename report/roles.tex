\section{Member Roles}
We ended up pair programming most of the setting up the dev environment and collecting the dataset, etc. We initially tried using a VM, but then we settled on using Google Colab for the free GPU access it provides. We are using a shared Jupyter notebook on Google Colab. Now that we have our pipeline established, we plan to investigate different models.
Broadly speaking, we've been sticking to our initially planned roles. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ashwin Ramesh : Explore methods and parameter optimizations. 
    \item Ram Gupta : Explore data transformations and structural optimizations
    \item Suyup Kim : Explore training/testing regimes and model selection. 
\end{itemize}
