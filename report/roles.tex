\section{Member Roles}
We ended up pair programming most of the setting up the dev environment and collecting the dataset, etc. We initially tried using a VM, but then we settled on using Google Colab for the free GPU access it provides. We are used a shared Jupyter notebook on Google Colab. Broadly speaking, the work was split up in the following way: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ashwin Ramesh : KNN, keypoint matching approaches using SIFT and ORB descriptors, data preprocessing
    \item Ram Gupta : Transfer learning approaches, data augmentation and parameter optimization
    \item Suyup Kim : Bounding box model approaches, training with parts of the network, and facial detection
\end{itemize}

In addition, all three of us worked together to discuss characteristics of the dataset and model, do research on and decide the main methods. Also, we had to collaborate at various points to share the preprocessing pipeline with data augmentations.
