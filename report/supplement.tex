\section{Supplemental Files}
\paragraph{Requirements}
In addition to the narratives (which are submitted as a single PDF report), several of the above parts may require the submission of supplemental files:
\begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]
	\item No supplemental files are needed (??)
	\item As supplemental information, include (1) a copy of the OpenRefine Operation History (copy-paste it into a file OR-history.json), (2) the YW rendering, and (3) a copy of your output file.
	\item If you use an OpenRefine alternative, answer the analogous questions as for OpenRefine (in the narrative and submit analogous history files or other provenance information (as available for that tool).
	\item In the narrative, explain (and show) how you go the data into SQLite (e.g., directly from the SQLite prompt, via a script, or a GUI), and explain the ICs and queries. As supplemental information submit SQL files (and load scripts, when available).
	\item When using YesWorkflow, submit (1) the file that has the annotations (e.g., myworkflow.txt), (2) the Graphviz/DOT file generated (e.g., myworkflow.gv), and (3) a screenshot of the rendered workflow (this screenshot/figure should be directly included in the narrative part).
\end{enumerate}
